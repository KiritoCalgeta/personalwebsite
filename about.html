            <h1>I'm Cal Usher</h1>
            <p>My journey up to this point has been an interesting, if not convuluted, one to say the least. I currently live in Edinburgh, Scotland, and despite winter's best efforts to ruin my time here, <br>
                I am quite inamid of this lovely city. I moved here at the end of 2021 in order to finish my personal training qualification and then pursue the industry. Since then I have completed my full qualification <br>
            and have been actively training clients ever since. However, I wanted something... More.</p>
            <p>Back in 2020, during lockdown, I dabbled in learning to code. I took on the Code Institute's 5 day challenge and really enjoyed it, however, without the support and guidance of teachers and mentors,<br>
            I foudn that I could not continue to learn effectively. I tried, but in the end, I had to stop.</p>
            <p>Fast forward 3 years and I have recently completed my Codespace bootcamp at Edinburgh College, focusing on full-stack development. In this course I gained knowledge in a number of languages, <br>
                styling processes, back-end databases and testing frameworks. These include:<br>
            1. JavaScript<br>
            2. PHP<br>
            3. HTML<br>
            4. CSS<br>
            5. MySQL<br>
            6. Cypress</p>
